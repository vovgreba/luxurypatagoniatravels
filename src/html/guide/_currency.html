      <h2>Currency</h2>
      <p>Patagonia spans both Chile and Argentina, so transactions are conducted in Chilean Pesos (CLP) and Argentine Pesos (ARS). While major credit cards are widely accepted in cities and tourist areas, carrying some local cash is essential for smaller towns and rural areas. ATMs are available but may be less frequent in remote regions. It's advisable to exchange some currency before arrival to avoid any inconveniences.</p>
