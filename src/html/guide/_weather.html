      <h2>Weather and Climate</h2>
      <p>Patagonia is known for its unpredictable climate, where you can experience all four seasons in a single day. Summers (December to February) are cool with longer daylight hours, ideal for trekking, while winters are cold and best for snow sports. Always be prepared for sudden changes in weather.</p>
